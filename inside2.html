  <p> I give Albert back the letter and he continues to explain that
    there is an infinite series of times, in a growing, dizzying net of divergent,
    convergent, and parallel times. He explains that we have met before in
    alternate timelines. I felt the swarming sensation of which I have spoken.
    It seemed to me that the humid garden that surrounded the house was
    infinitely saturated with invisible persons. Those persons were Albert
    and I, secret, busy and multiform in other dimensions of time. I raised my
   eyes and the tenuous nightmare dissolved. In the yellow and black garden
   there was only one man; but this man was as strong as a statue . . . this
    man was approaching along the path and he was Captain Richard Madden. It
    was time to make a decision. I have one bullet left. Should I use it to
    kill Albert to convey the location of the weapons or use it to kill
    Madden to save myself?
