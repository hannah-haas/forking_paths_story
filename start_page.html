   <p> Welcome to the Garden of Forking Paths! </p>
   <p>
     In this interactive story/game, you are in the role of Dr. Yu Tsun, a German spy in London.
     This story is based on the "Garden of Forking Paths" story by Jorge Luis Borges.
     "The garden of forking paths" discusses how there is an infinite web of parallel universes, where
     time diverges onto various paths. In the story, Dr. Yu Tsun experiences just one of many paths as
     he runs away from Captain Madden after his cover as a spy was blown. In this story/game you play as
     Dr. Yu Tsun trying to convey the location of the weapons and running from Captain Madden. You will
     need to make decisions and figure out riddles. Based on your decisions and answers, you will go along
     on different paths. All of the paths except for one (the winning one!) end in your failure, either
     by failing to communicate the location of the weapons or capture by Captain Madden.

    If you have not read "The Garden of Forking Paths", please do so before starting the game as some of the
    paths and clues require knowledge of the story. To play the game, start by clicking "start". After that you
    will be brought to the first page. From there each page will have either a choice of buttons to click on,
    pictures to click on, or text input. By clicking or inputting, you will be brought to a new page where the
    game/story will continue. The end of each path will either end in victory or failure. At any point of
    the game, you can restart by clicking "start over" in the bottom corner.
