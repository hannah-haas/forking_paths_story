   <p> I know where the new British artillery is. And now Captain Madden knows that I have
     this knowledge and is hunting me down. "How might I make it carry to the ear of the Chief?"
     How can I escape Madden? </p>
   <p> I said out loud: I must flee. 1 sat up noiselessly, in a useless
     perfection of silence, as if Madden were already lying in wait for me,
     Something—perhaps the mere vain ostentation of proving my resources
     were nil—made me look through my pockets, I found what I knew I would
     find. The American watch chief gave you, the nickel chain and the square coin,
     the key ring with the incriminating useless keys to Runeberg’s apartment,
     the notebook, the locked capsule from chief for emergencies, a letter which
     I resolved to destroy immediately (and which I did not destroy), a crown,
     two shillings and a few pence, the red and blue pencil, the handkerchief,
     the revolver with one bullet. </p>

     <p> I decide my safest bet is to board a train and get out of London before Madden gets
       to my house. </p>
