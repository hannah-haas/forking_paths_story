  <p> I reach for the gun in my pocket with the single bullet. Albert once again
    rises and turns to his bookshelf. While grabbing a small box he starts "Use
    this to esc..." and before he can finish and turn, I fire, not wanting to shoot him
    while looking into his eyes. The box and his body drop. With little time to spare,
    I grab the box, opening it to reveal a key.

  <p> I hear Madden approaching outside and quickly jump to my feet and run to
      the back door. It's locked! What should I do?
